A list of projects I have done professionally and as time pass

1) ACO observations- have experience working with these signals as time series before and only. Here raw data is aggregation VIN (vehicle identification number) and have taken max, min and average statistic of ACO obtained from Vehicle over a period of time (see synthetic data for more details). performed EDA on this data - analysing for road type on which high ACOs are observed, VIN count in high ACO zone (90th percentile)
