Predicting Braking Instances: A Novel Approach1. Data Ingestion & Initial Cleaning 🧹Source Data: Raw vehicle telematics (VIN, Trip ID, GPS Timestamp, Vehicle Speed).Purpose: Prepare data for feature engineering by ensuring correct types and initial structuring.2. Feature Engineering 🛠️Core Principle: Create features from raw VhclSpd to represent driving dynamics.Calculated Features:Acceleration from Speed (g): Derived from speed and time differences.Lagged Features: Past values of VhclSpd and Acceleration (e.g., VhclSpd_lag_1 to VhclSpd_lag_12, acc_from_spd_g_lag1, acc_from_spd_g_lag2). Crucial for historical context.Lead Features (Novel Element!): Future values of VhclSpd and Acceleration (e.g., VhclSpd_lead_1 to VhclSpd_lead_5, acc_from_spd_g_lead_1 to acc_from_spd_g_lead_3). Used for enhanced historical analysis/labeling where future information is permissible.Tools: Pandas operations for feature creation (in a single-node context). For large-scale data, PySpark Window Functions (F.lag, F.lead) are recommended.3. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning 🧠Objective: Achieve high Recall (>0.85) for the 'Brake Pressed' class (Class 1.0).Model Selection:Initial exploration: Decision Tree.Optimized Choice: Random Forest Classifier. Chosen for its robustness, ability to handle non-linearity, and ensemble power.Imbalance Handling:class_weight='balanced': Applied in RandomForestClassifier to give more importance to the minority class during training.Prediction Threshold Tuning: Post-training adjustment of the probability threshold (from default 0.5) to increase recall for Class 1.0, while managing precision.Hyperparameter Optimization: GridSearchCV for exhaustive tuning of key Random Forest parameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features), optimizing for recall_class_1.Tool: scikit-learn library.4. Model Deployment & Prediction Pipeline 🚀Serialization:Trained Model: Save the RandomForestClassifier object using pickle.Fitted Scaler: Crucially, save the StandardScaler (or chosen scaler) after it's fitted on the training data.Prediction on New Data:Consistent Feature Engineering: Apply the exact same feature engineering steps (lags, leads, accelerations) to new unseen data.Consistent Scaling: Load the saved scaler and use its .transform() method on new features. Crucial for consistent feature representation.Prediction: Use the loaded model's predict_proba() method to get probabilities.Threshold Application: Apply the optimized prediction threshold (found during tuning) to convert probabilities into binary predictions.Mapping: Integrate predictions back into the original data structure, typically by joining on unique identifiers (Timestamp, VIN, Trip ID).
