## **Predicting Braking Instances: A Novel Approach**

### 1\. Data Ingestion & Initial Cleaning 🧹

* **Source Data:** Raw vehicle telematics (VIN, Trip ID, GPS Timestamp, Vehicle Speed).  
* **Purpose:** Prepare data for feature engineering by ensuring correct types and initial structuring.

### 2\. Feature Engineering 🛠️

* **Core Principle:** Create features from raw VhclSpd to represent driving dynamics.  
* **Calculated Features:**  
  * Acceleration from Speed (g): Derived from speed and time differences.  
  * **Lagged Features:** Past values of VhclSpd and Acceleration (e.g., VhclSpd\_lag\_1 to VhclSpd\_lag\_12, acc\_from\_spd\_g\_lag1, acc\_from\_spd\_g\_lag2). *Crucial for historical context.*  
  * **Lead Features (Novel Element\!):** Future values of VhclSpd and Acceleration (e.g., VhclSpd\_lead\_1 to VhclSpd\_lead\_5, acc\_from\_spd\_g\_lead\_1 to acc\_from\_spd\_g\_lead\_3). *Used for enhanced historical analysis/labeling where future information is permissible.*  
* **Tools:** Pandas operations for feature creation (in a single-node context). For large-scale data, PySpark Window Functions (F.lag, F.lead) are recommended.

### 3\. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning 🧠

* Objective: Achieve high Recall (\>0.85) for the 'Brake Pressed' class (Class 1.0).  
* **Model Selection:**  
  * Initial exploration: Decision Tree.  
  * **Optimized Choice:** Random Forest Classifier. Chosen for its robustness, ability to handle non-linearity, and ensemble power.  
* **Imbalance Handling:**  
  * class\_weight='balanced': Applied in RandomForestClassifier to give more importance to the minority class during training.  
  * **Prediction Threshold Tuning:** Post-training adjustment of the probability threshold (from default 0.5) to increase recall for Class 1.0, while managing precision.  
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** GridSearchCV for exhaustive tuning of key Random Forest parameters (n\_estimators, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, max\_features), optimizing for recall\_class\_1.  
* **Tool:** scikit-learn library.

### 4\. Model Deployment & Prediction Pipeline 🚀

* **Serialization:**  
  * **Trained Model:** Save the RandomForestClassifier object using pickle.  
  * **Fitted Scaler:** Crucially, save the StandardScaler (or chosen scaler) *after* it's fitted on the training data.  
* **Prediction on New Data:**  
  * **Consistent Feature Engineering:** Apply the *exact same* feature engineering steps (lags, leads, accelerations) to new unseen data.  
  * **Consistent Scaling:** Load the *saved* scaler and use its .transform() method on new features. **Crucial for consistent feature representation.**  
  * **Prediction:** Use the loaded model's predict\_proba() method to get probabilities.  
  * **Threshold Application:** Apply the *optimized prediction threshold* (found during tuning) to convert probabilities into binary predictions.  
* **Mapping:** Integrate predictions back into the original data structure, typically by joining on unique identifiers (Timestamp, VIN, Trip ID).
